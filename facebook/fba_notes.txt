Here's a little blurb about how I approached feature generation and cross-validation for this problem:

code: https://github.com/small-yellow-duck/facebook_auction

I used sklearn's RandomForestClassifier. The most useful features I identified were:

the median time between a user's bid and that user's previous bid
the mean number of bids a user made per auction
the entropy for how many bids a user placed on each day of the week
the means of the per-auction URL entropy and IP entropy for each user
the maximum number of bids in a 20 min span
the total number of bids placed by the user
the average number of bids a user placed per referring URL
the number of bids placed by the user on each of the three weekdays in the data
the minimum and median times between a user's bid and the previous bid by another user in the same auction.
the fraction of IPs used by a bidder which were also used by another user which was a bot
Cross-validation was a bit tricky: I did CV 100 times on different 80-20 splits. My mean CV score was almost the same (+/- 0.003) as my final leaderboard score.

edit to answer some further questions:

In order to convert the time scale to hours, I made a bids/unit time histogram and looked at the periodicity - bidding volumes cycled with a period of one day. There are pretty graphs and more details on my github page.

A concrete example of the entropy is the IP entropy: N!/(N_{IP1}! N{IP2}!... N{IPn}!). N is the total number of bids and N_{IPn} is the total number of bids placed from the nth IP. (Because the entropy is a large number, I used the log of the entropy.) The entropy is a measure of how both randomly distributed the bids are, how many IPs there are and how many bids there are. A bidder that places all their bids from the same IP has an entropy of N!/N! = 1.

I used the simple average of five RandomForestClassifiers (each with a different value for the initialization parameter, random_state) to generate the predictions.

Thanks to everyone else who shared their approaches! I thought that leaving out the bots with only one bid was a clever idea. And I was surprised to see that people got mileage out of the device type.
